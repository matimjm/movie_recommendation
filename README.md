***

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed. You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ’¾ Getting the Data

The dataset for this project is too large to be stored on GitHub. It is hosted on **Hugging Face Hub** and needs to be downloaded before you can run the project.

You can download the data by running a simple Python script. First, ensure you have the `huggingface_hub` library installed:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Then, you can use the following Python code to download the necessary files into your project directory.

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import os

# --- Configuration ---
HF_REPO_ID = "your-username/your-repo-name" # <-- IMPORTANT: Replace with your repo ID
FILES_TO_DOWNLOAD = [
    "TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv",
    "movie_embeddings.npy"
    # Add other data files here if you have more
]
# ---------------------

print("Downloading data files from Hugging Face Hub...")

for file in FILES_TO_DOWNLOAD:
    try:
        # Download the file and place it in a 'data/' subdirectory
        downloaded_path = hf_hub_download(
            repo_id=HF_REPO_ID,
            filename=file,
            repo_type="dataset",
            local_dir="data/" # This will save files to a ./data/ folder
        )
        print(f"Successfully downloaded {file} to {downloaded_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while downloading {file}: {e}")

print("\nData download complete!")

```

**Pro-Tip:** Save the code above as a file named `download_data.py` in your project's root directory. This way, new users can simply run `python download_data.py` to get everything they need.
